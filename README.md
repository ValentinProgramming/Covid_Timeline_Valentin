# Covid_Timeline_Valentin
Covid Timeline Application using React

Setup Instructions:
-Type "npm install" in a command prompt in the repository;
-Type "yarn start" in a command prompt in the repository;
-The application will be running on port 3000, you can access through "localhost:3000" if not automatically opening;

I made the choice of not allowing overlapping time entries (i.e., it is not possible to register 2 time entries that occurred partly or fully on the same period).

Further possible improvements:
-Adding Backend & Linking the application to a Database so that the data remain after closing the application;
-Improving responsiveness;
-Adding a modification feature of the existing time entries;
-Making possible to have time entries occurring on a period longer than 1 day;
